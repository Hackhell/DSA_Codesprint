<h1>Recursion</h1>

Recursion is the process which comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. Any function 
which calls itself is called recursive function, and such function calls are called recursive calls. Recursion involves several numbers 
of recursive calls. However, it is important to impose a termination condition of recursion.

# DSA_Codesprint

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms questions commonly asked in coding interviews. The level of difficulty for these problems range from easy to medium with a few hard questions.

The objective of this repository is two fold : 

i) To help fellow programmers to prepare for technical interviews by providing a single space containing practise problems with their solutions.

ii) **Codesprint Challenge** - I wanted to challenge myself to solve as many data structure and algorithmic problems as possible in 12 continuous hours. 

I will update this file with the final stats after I complete the challenge.

# DSA_Codesprint

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms questions commonly asked in coding interviews. The level of difficulty for these problems range from easy to medium with a few hard questions. The language used is C++.

The objective of this repository to help fellow programmers prepare for technical interviews by providing a single space containing good quality problems with their solutions for  practise and revision.

This started with my idea of taking on Codesprint challenge.

**Codesprint Challenge** - I wanted to challenge myself to solve as many data structure and algorithmic problems as possible in 12 hours. 

I will update this file with the final stats after I complete the challenge.

<h3> <i>Stats from the challenge</i></h3>

- Completed 39 questions

- Number of topics worked on - 8

  

My aim is to maintain this repository further with good quality questions along with quick notes for each topic. I will be more than happy to receive contributions. 

Let us together make this repository a great place to practise and revise coding interview questions. 

Possible contributions - 

1) Quick notes on each topic

2) More problems and solutions 

3) Questions in other programming languages - Python, Java, C etc.



Cheers
